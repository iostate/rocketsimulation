This is just pseudo code

define variables

mr = mass of rocket (in kg variable input)
mf = mass of fuel (in kg fixed 1000kg at first then varies)
mt = total mass = mr + mf
br = burn rate
final height = input of final height (in m variable)
hf = our final target height <----------------- set this to final height + range so our final target height is the top of range
hi = current height
h' = delta h = hf - hi
F1 = force of fuel posing rocket (in N)
F2 = force of fuel posing rocket (in N)
Vnozz = Nozzle velocity (in m/s fixed 2000m/s)
a = acceleration (in m/s^2)
vf = final velo. (in m/s)
vi = initial velo. (in m/s) // set vi to zero at start
v' = change in velo (in m/s)
r = range (in m variable)
rt = range top (in m variable) <------- rt = final height + range
rb = range bottom (in m variable) <------- rb = final height - range
T = our set time (in s)


while t < 0.5 and flag = 0 (take off function)

	mt = mr + mf
	F1 = mt * 109 	// 109 here is max accel. and so we don't go over 100 by decimal places
	br = F1/Vnozz
	mf = mf - br * 0.1 	// 0.1 is the time slice
	mt = mr + mf 		// need to recalculate for next equation
	a = (F1 / mt) - 10	
	hi = vi * 0.1 + 0.5 * a * 0.1 * 0.1
	vf = vi + a * 0.1
	vi = vf
	h' = hf - hi
	
loop every 0.1 while flag = 0 (main function for flying to target) 

	mt = mr + mf
	F2 = (vi^2 * mt) / (2 h')
	F1 = mt * 109
	
	if F1 < F2
		br = F1 / Vnozz // this is a check to make sure we don't exceed max accel.

	else
		br = F2 / Vnozz

	mf = mf - br * 0.1

	while  hi = rb

		vf = sqrt(2 * 10 * h')	// This is calc finds final velo from falling from rt to rb 
		F2 = (vf^2 * mt) / (2 * h')
